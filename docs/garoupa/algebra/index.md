Module garoupa.algebra
======================
Abstract algebra groups

This module was useful while studying alternative groups before sticking with UT(n,p).
It is kept here in the hope someone find it useful.
However, it is not the focus of this package.
Some classes require 'poetry install -E full' to add numpy or other heavy dependencies.
